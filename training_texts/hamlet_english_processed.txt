project gutenberg etexts are usually created from multiple editions 
all of which are in the public domain in the united states unless a 
copyright notice is included therefore we usually do  keep any 
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition 


we are now trying to release all our books one month in advance 
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing 

please note neither this list nor its contents are final till 
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement 
the official release date of all project gutenberg etexts is at 
midnight central time of the last day of the stated month  
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment 
and editing by those who wish to do so to be sure you have an 
up to date first edition  please check file sizes 
in the first week of the next month since our ftp program has 
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a 
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a 
new copy has at least one byte more or less 


information about project gutenberg one page 

we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work the 
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours 
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright 
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc this 
projected audience is one hundred million readers if our value 
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce  
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text 
files per month or  more etexts in  for a total of  
if these reach just  of the computerized population then the 
total should reach over  billion etexts given away this year 

the goal of project gutenberg is to give away one trillion etext 
files by december    x    trillion 
this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers 
which is only  of the present number of computer users 

at our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird 
of that goal by the end of  or about  etexts unless we 
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly 
from michael harts salary at carnegiemellon university and an 
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few 
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we 
dont want project gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

project gutenbergs etext of shakespeares the tragedie of hamlet 




executive directors notes 

in addition to the notes below and so you will  think all 
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have 
been corrected here are the first few lines of hamlet as they 
are presented herein 

barnardo whos there 
fran nay answer me stand  vnfold 
your selfe 

bar long liue the king 

 

as  understand it the printers often ran out of certain words 
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the 
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling 
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions 
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u 
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming 
shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner    

the answer is that they  have packed liue into a cliche at a 
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in 
place of some ws etc this was a common practice of the day 
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend 
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to 

you will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as  
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an 
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a 
very high place in the canon of shakespeare my father read an 
assortment of these made available to him by cambridge university 
in england for several months in a glass room constructed for the 
purpose to the best of my knowledge he read  those available 
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes 
that shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a 
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous 
for signing his name with several different spellings 

so please take this into account when reading the comments below 
made by our volunteer who prepared this file you may see errors 
that are not errors    

so  with this caveat  we have  changed the canon errors 
here is the project gutenberg etext of shakespeares the tragedie 
of hamlet

scanners notes what this is and isnt this was taken from 
a copy of shakespeares first folio and it is as close as  can 
come in  to the printed text 

the elongated ss have been changed to small ss and the 
conjoined ae have been changed to ae  have left the spelling 
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the 
printed text  have corrected some spelling mistakes  have put 
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the 
geneva bible and shakespeares first folio and have unified 
spellings according to this template typos and expanded 
abbreviations as  have come across them everything within 
brackets  is what  have added so if you dont like that 
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a 
purer shakespeare 

another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual 
differences between various copies of the first folio so there may 
be differences other than what  have mentioned above between 
this and other first folio editions this is due to the printers 
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and 
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then 
continuing the printing run the proof run wasnt thrown away but 
incorporated into the printed copies this is just the way it is 
the text  have used was a composite of more than  different 
first folio editions best pages 

if you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation 
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel 
free to email me those errors  wish to make this the best 
etext possible my email address for right now are haraddaaolcom 
and davidrinconnectcom  hope that you enjoy this

mar holla barnardo 

bar say what is horatio there 
hor  peece of him 

bar welcome horatio welcome good marcellus 

mar what has this thing appeard againe to night 

bar  haue seene nothing 

mar horatio saies tis but our fantasie 
and will not let beleefe take hold of him 
touching this dreaded sight twice seene of vs 
therefore  haue intreated him along 
with vs to watch the minutes of this night 
that if againe this apparition come 
he may approue our eyes and speake to it 

hor tush tush twill not appeare 

bar sit downe awhile 
and let vs once againe assaile your eares 
that are so fortified against our story 
what we two nights haue seene 

hor well sit we downe 
and let vs heare barnardo speake of this 

barn last night of all 
when yond same starre thats westward from the pole 
had made his course t illume that part of heauen 
where now it burnes marcellus and my selfe

barn how now horatio you tremble  look pale 
is not this something more then fantasie 
what thinke you ont 
hor before my god  might not this beleeue 
without the sensible and true auouch 
of mine owne eyes 

mar is it not like the king 
hor as thou art to thy selfe 
such was the very armour he had on 
when th ambitious norwey combatted 
so frownd he once when in an angry parle 
he smot the sledded pollax on the ice 
tis strange 

mar thus twice before and iust at this dead houre 
with martiall stalke hath he gone by our watch 

hor in what particular thought to work  know not 
but in the grosse and scope of my opinion 
this boades some strange erruption to our state 

mar good now sit downe  tell me he that knowes 
why this same strict and most obseruant watch 
so nightly toyles the subiect of the land 
and why such dayly cast of brazon cannon 
and forraigne mart for implements of warre 
why such impresse of shipwrights whose sore taske 
dos not diuide the sunday from the weeke 
what might be toward that this sweaty hast 
doth make the night ioyntlabourer with the day 
who ist that can informe me 
hor that can  
at least the whisper goes so our last king 
whose image euen but now appeard to vs 
was as you know by fortinbras of norway 
thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride 
dard to the combate in which our valiant hamlet 
for so this side of our knowne world esteemd him 
did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact 
well ratified by law and heraldrie 
did forfeite with his life all those his lands 
which he stood seizd on to the conqueror 
against the which a moity competent 
was gaged by our king which had returnd 
to the inheritance of fortinbras 
had he bin vanquisher as by the same counant 
and carriage of the article designe 
his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras 
of vnimproued mettle hot and full 
hath in the skirts of norway heere and there 
sharkd vp a list of landlesse resolutes 
for foode and diet to some enterprize 
that hath a stomacke int which is no other 
and it doth well appeare vnto our state 
but to recouer of vs by strong hand 
and termes compulsatiue those foresaid lands 
so by his father lost and this  take it 
is the maine motiue of our preparations 
the sourse of this our watch and the cheefe head 
of this posthast and romage in the land 
enter ghost againe 

but soft behold loe where it comes againe 
ile crosse it though it blast me stay illusion 
if thou hast any sound or vse of voyce 
speake to me if there be any good thing to be done 
that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me 
if thou art priuy to thy countries fate 
which happily foreknowing may auoyd oh speake 
or if thou hast vphoorded in thy life 
extorted treasure in the wombe of earth 
for which they say you spirits oft walke in death 
speake of it stay and speake stop it marcellus 

mar shall  strike at it with my partizan 
hor do if it will not stand 

barn tis heere 

hor tis heere 

mar tis gone 

exit ghost 

we do it wrong being so maiesticall 
to offer it the shew of violence 
for it is as the ayre invulnerable 
and our vaine blowes malicious mockery 

barn it was about to speake when the cocke crew 

hor and then it started like a guilty thing 
vpon a fearfull summons  haue heard 
the cocke that is the trumpet to the day 
doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throate 
awake the god of day and at his warning 
whether in sea or fire in earth or ayre 
th extrauagant and erring spirit hyes 
to his confine and of the truth heerein 
this present obiect made probation 

mar it faded on the crowing of the cocke 
some sayes that euer gainst that season comes 
wherein our sauiours birch is celebrated 
the bird of dawning singeth all night long 
and then they say no spirit can walke abroad 
the nights are wholsome then no planets strike 
no faiery talkes nor witch hath power to charme 
so hallowd and so gracious is the time 

hor so haue  heard and do in part beleeue it 
but looke the morne in russet mantle clad 
walkes ore the dew of yon high easterne hill 
breake we our watch vp and by my aduice 
let vs impart what we haue seene to night 
vnto yong hamlet for vpon my life 
this spirit dumbe to vs will speake to him 
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it 
as needfull in our loues fitting our duty 
mar let dot  pray and  this morning know 
where we shall finde him most conueniently

scena secunda 

enter claudius king of denmarke gertrude the queene hamlet 
polonius 
laertes and his sister ophelia lords attendant 

king though yet of hamlet our deere brothers death 
the memory be greene and that it vs befitted 
to beare our hearts in greefe and our whole kingdome 
to be contracted in one brow of woe 
yet so farre hath discretion fought with nature 
that we with wisest sorrow thinke on him 
together with remembrance of our selues 
therefore our sometimes sister now our queene 
th imperiall ioyntresse of this warlike state 
haue we as twere with a defeated ioy 
with one auspicious and one dropping eye 
with mirth in funerall and with dirge in marriage 
in equall scale weighing delight and dole 
taken to wife nor haue we heerein barrd 
your better wisedomes which haue freely gone 
with this affaire along for all our thankes 
now followes that you know young fortinbras 
holding a weake supposall of our worth 
or thinking by our late deere brothers death 
our state to be disioynt and out of frame 
colleagued with the dreame of his aduantage 
he hath not fayld to pester vs with message 
importing the surrender of those lands 
lost by his father with all bonds of law 
to our most valiant brother so much for him 
enter voltemand and cornelius 

now for our selfe and for this time of meeting 
thus much the businesse is we haue heere writ 
to norway vncle of young fortinbras 
who impotent and bedrid scarsely heares 
of this his nephewes purpose to suppresse 
his further gate heerein in that the leuies 
the lists and full proportions are all made 
out of his subiect and we heere dispatch 
you good cornelius and you voltemand 
for bearing of this greeting to old norway 
giuing to you no further personall power 
to businesse with the king more then the scope 
of these dilated articles allow 
farewell and let your hast commend your duty 

volt in that and all things will we shew our duty 

king we doubt it nothing heartily farewell 

exit voltemand and cornelius 

and now laertes whats the newes with you 
you told vs of some suite what ist laertes 
you cannot speake of reason to the dane 
and loose your voyce what wouldst thou beg laertes 
that shall not be my offer not thy asking 
the head is not more natiue to the heart 
the hand more instrumentall to the mouth 
then is the throne of denmarke to thy father 
what wouldst thou haue laertes 
laer dread my lord 
your leaue and fauour to returne to france 
from whence though willingly  came to denmarke 
to shew my duty in your coronation 
yet now  must confesse that duty done 
my thoughts and wishes bend againe towards france 
and bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon 

king haue you your fathers leaue 
what sayes pollonius 
pol he hath my lord 
 do beseech you giue him leaue to go 

king take thy faire houre laertes time be thine 
and thy best graces spend it at thy will 
but now my cosin hamlet and my sonne 
ham  little more then kin and lesse then kinde 

king how is it that the clouds still hang on you 
ham not so my lord  am too much ith sun 

queen good hamlet cast thy nightly colour off 
and let thine eye looke like a friend on denmarke 
do not for euer with thy veyled lids 
seeke for thy noble father in the dust 
thou knowst tis common all that liues must dye 
passing through nature to eternity 

ham  madam it is common 

queen if it be 
why seemes it so particular with thee 

ham seemes madam nay it is  know not seemes 
tis not alone my inky cloake good mother 
nor customary suites of solemne blacke 
nor windy suspiration of forcd breath 
no nor the fruitfull riuer in the eye 
nor the deiected hauiour of the visage 
together with all formes moods shewes of griefe 
that can denote me truly these indeed seeme 
for they are actions that a man might play 
but  haue that within which passeth show 
these but the trappings and the suites of woe 

king tis sweet and commendable 
in your nature hamlet 
to giue these mourning duties to your father 
but you must know your father lost a father 
that father lost lost his and the suruiuer bound 
in filiall obligation for some terme 
to do obsequious sorrow but to perseuer 
in obstinate condolement is a course 
of impious stubbornnesse tis vnmanly greefe 
it shewes a will most incorrect to heauen 
 heart vnfortified a minde impatient 
an vnderstanding simple and vnschoold 
for what we know must be and is as common 
as any the most vulgar thing to sence 
why should we in our peeuish opposition 
take it to heart fye tis a fault to heauen 
 fault against the dead a fault to nature 
to reason most absurd whose common theame 
is death of fathers and who still hath cried 
from the first coarse till he that dyed to day 
this must be so we pray you throw to earth 
this vnpreuayling woe and thinke of vs 
as of a father for let the world take note 
you are the most immediate to our throne 
and with no lesse nobility of loue 
then that which deerest father beares his sonne 
do  impart towards you for your intent 
in going backe to schoole in wittenberg 
it is most retrograde to our desire 
and we beseech you bend you to remaine 
heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye 
our cheefest courtier cosin and our sonne 

qu let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet 
 prythee stay with vs go not to wittenberg 

ham  shall in all my best 
obey you madam 

king why tis a louing and a faire reply 
be as our selfe in denmarke madam come 
this gentle and vnforcd accord of hamlet 
sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof 
no iocond health that denmarke drinkes to day 
but the great cannon to the clowds shall tell 
and the kings rouce the heauens shall bruite againe 
respeaking earthly thunder come away 

exeunt 

manet hamlet 

ham oh that this too too solid flesh would melt 
thaw and resolue it selfe into a dew 
or that the euerlasting had not fixt 
his cannon gainst selfeslaughter  god  god 
how weary stale flat and vnprofitable 
seemes to me all the vses of this world 
fie ont oh fie fie tis an vnweeded garden 
that growes to seed things rank and grosse in nature 
possesse it meerely that it should come to this 
but two months dead nay not so much not two 
so excellent a king that was to this 
hiperion to a satyre so louing to my mother 
that he might not beteene the windes of heauen 
visit her face too roughly heauen and earth 
must  remember why she would hang on him 
as if encrease of appetite had growne 
by what is fed on and yet within a month 
let me not thinke ont frailty thy name is woman 
 little month or ere those shooes were old 
with which she followed my poore fathers body 
like niobe all teares why she euen she 
 heauen  beast that wants discourse of reason 
would haue mournd longer married with mine vnkle 
my fathers brother but no more like my father 
then  to hercules within a moneth 
ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous teares 
had left the flushing of her gauled eyes 
she married  most wicked speed to post 
with such dexterity to incestuous sheets 
it is not nor it cannot come to good 
but breake my heart for  must hold my tongue

appeares before them and with sollemne march 
goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkt 
by their opprest and fearesurprized eyes 
within his truncheons length whilst they bestild 
almost to ielly with the act of feare 
stand dumbe and speake not to him this to me 
in dreadfull secrecie impart they did 
and  with them the third night kept the watch 
whereas they had deliuerd both in time

but euen then the morning cocke crew lowd 
and at the sound it shrunke in hast away 
and vanisht from our sight

scena tertia 


enter laertes and ophelia 

laer my necessaries are imbarkt farewell 
and sister as the winds giue benefit 
and conuoy is assistant doe not sleepe 
but let me heare from you 

ophel doe you doubt that 
laer for hamlet and the trifling of his fauours 
hold it a fashion and a toy in bloude 
 violet in the youth of primy nature 
froward not permanent sweet not lasting 
the suppliance of a minute no more 

ophel no more but so 

laer thinke it no more 
for nature cressant does not grow alone 
in thewes and bulke but as his temple waxes 
the inward seruice of the minde and soule 
growes wide withall perhaps he loues you now 
and now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch 
the vertue of his feare but you must feare 
his greatnesse weighd his will is not his owne 
for hee himselfe is subiect to his birth 
hee may not as vnuallued persons doe 
carue for himselfe for on his choyce depends 
the sanctity and health of the whole state 
and therefore must his choyce be circumscribd 
vnto the voyce and yeelding of that body 
whereof he is the head then if he sayes he loues you 
it fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it 
as he in his peculiar sect and force 
may giue his saying deed which is no further 
then the maine voyce of denmarke goes withall 
then weight what losse your honour may sustaine 
if with too credent eare you list his songs 
or lose your heart or your chast treasure open 
to his vnmastred importunity 
feare it ophelia feare it my deare sister 
and keepe within the reare of your affection 
out of the shot and danger of desire 
the chariest maid is prodigall enough 
if she vnmaske her beauty to the moone 
vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes 
the canker galls the infants of the spring 
too oft before the buttons be disclosd 
and in the morne and liquid dew of youth 
contagious blastments are most imminent 
be wary then best safety lies in feare 
youth to it selfe rebels though none else neere 

ophe  shall th effect of this good lesson keepe 
as watchmen to my heart but good my brother 
doe not as some vngracious pastors doe 
shew me the steepe and thorny way to heauen 
whilst like a puft and recklesse libertine 
himselfe the primrose path of dalliance treads 
and reaks not his owne reade 

laer oh feare me not 
enter polonius 

 stay too long but here my father comes 
 double blessing is a double grace 
occasion smiles vpon a second leaue 

polon yet heere laertes aboord aboord for shame 
the winde sits in the shoulder of your saile 
and you are staid for there my blessing with you 
and these few precepts in thy memory 
see thou character giue thy thoughts no tongue 
nor any vnproportiond thoughts his act 
be thou familiar but by no meanes vulgar 
the friends thou hast and their adoption tride 
grapple them to thy soule with hoopes of steele 
but doe not dull thy palme with entertainment 
of each vnhatcht vnfledgd comrade beware 
of entrance to a quarrell but being in 
beart that th opposed may beware of thee 
giue euery man thine eare but few thy voyce 
take each mans censure but reserue thy iudgement 
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy 
but not exprest in fancie rich not gawdie 
for the apparell oft proclaimes the man 
and they in france of the best ranck and station 
are of a most select and generous cheff in that 
neither a borrower nor a lender be 
for lone oft loses both it selfe and friend 
and borrowing duls the edge of husbandry 
this aboue all to thine owne selfe be true 
and it must follow as the night the day 
thou canst not then be false to any man 
farewell my blessing season this in thee 

laer most humbly doe  take my leaue my lord 

polon the time inuites you goe your seruants tend 

laer farewell ophelia and remember well 
what  haue said to you 

ophe tis in my memory lockt 
and you your selfe shall keepe the key of it 

laer farewell 

exit laer 

polon what ist ophelia he hath said to you 
ophe so please you somthing touching the lord hamlet 

polon marry well bethought 
tis told me he hath very oft of late 
giuen priuate time to you and you your selfe 
haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous 
if it be so as so tis put on me 
and that in way of caution  must tell you 
you doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely 
as it behoues my daughter and your honour 
what is betweene you giue me vp the truth 
ophe he hath my lord of late made many tenders 
of his affection to me 

polon affection puh you speake like a greene girle 
vnsifted in such perillous circumstance 
doe you beleeue his tenders as you call them 
ophe  do not know my lord what  should thinke 

polon marry ile teach you thinke your selfe a baby 
that you haue tane his tenders for true pay 
which are not starling tender your selfe more dearly 
or not to crack the winde of the poore phrase 
roaming it thus youl tender me a foole 

ophe my lord he hath importund me with loue 
in honourable fashion 

polon  fashion you may call it go too go too 

ophe and hath giuen countenance to his speech 
my lord with all the vowes of heauen 

polon  springes to catch woodcocks  doe know 
when the bloud burnes how prodigall the soule 
giues the tongue vowes these blazes daughter 
giuing more light then heate extinct in both 
euen in their promise as it is a making 
you must not take for fire for this time daughter 
be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence 
set your entreatments at a higher rate 
then a command to parley for lord hamlet 
beleeue so much in him that he is young 
and with a larger tether may he walke 
then may be giuen you in few ophelia 
doe not beleeue his vowes for they are broakers 
not of the eye which their inuestments show 
but meere implorators of vnholy sutes 
breathing like sanctified and pious bonds 
the better to beguile this is for all 
 would not in plaine tearmes from this time forth 
haue you so slander any moment leisure 
as to giue words or talke with the lord hamlet 
looke toot  charge you come your wayes 

ophe  shall obey my lord

that swift as quicksiluer it courses through 
the naturall gates and allies of the body 
and with a sodaine vigour it doth posset 
and curd like aygre droppings into milke 
the thin and wholsome blood so did it mine 
and a most instant tetter bakd about 
most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust

reynol my lord  did intend it 

polon marry well said 
very well said looke you sir 
enquire me first what danskers are in paris 
and how and who what meanes and where they keepe 
what company at what expence and finding 
by this encompassement and drift of question

to youth and liberty 

reynol as gaming my lord 

polon  or drinking fencing swearing 
quarelling drabbing you may goe so farre 

reynol my lord that would dishonour him 

polon faith no as you may season it in the charge 
you must not put another scandall on him 
that hee is open to incontinencie 
thats not my meaning but breath his faults so quaintly 
that they may seeme the taints of liberty 
the flash and outbreake of a fiery minde 
 sauagenes in vnreclaimd bloud of generall assault 

reynol but my good lord 

polon wherefore should you doe this 
reynol  my lord  would know that 

polon marry sir heeres my drift 
and  belieue it is a fetch of warrant 
you laying these slight sulleyes on my sonne 
as twere a thing a little soild ith working 
marke you your party in conuerse him you would sound 
hauing euer seene in the prenominate crimes

there was he gaming there oretooke ins rouse 
there falling out at tennis or perchance 
 saw him enter such a house of saile 
videlicet a brothell or so forth see you now 
your bait of falshood takes this cape of truth 
and thus doe we of wisedome and of reach

enter ophelia 

polon farewell 
how now ophelia whats the matter 
ophe alas my lord  haue beene so affrighted 

polon with what in the name of heauen 
ophe my lord as  was sowing in my chamber 
lord hamlet with his doublet all vnbracd 
no hat vpon his head his stockings fould 
vngartred and downe giued to his anckle 
pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other 
and with a looke so pitious in purport 
as if he had been loosed out of hell 
to speake of horrors he comes before me 

polon mad for thy loue 
ophe my lord  doe not know but truly  do feare it 

polon what said he 
ophe he tooke me by the wrist and held me hard 
then goes he to the length of all his arme 
and with his other hand thus ore his brow 
he fals to such perusall of my face 
as he would draw it long staid he so 
at last a little shaking of mine arme 
and thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe 
he raisd a sigh so pittious and profound 
that it did seeme to shatter all his bulke 
and end his being that done he lets me goe 
and with his head ouer his shoulders turnd 
he seemd to finde his way without his eyes 
for out adores he went without their helpe 
and to the last bended their light on me 

polon goe with me  will goe seeke the king 
this is the very extasie of loue 
whose violent property foredoes it selfe 
and leads the will to desperate vndertakings 
as oft as any passion vnder heauen 
that does afflict our natures  am sorrie 
what haue you giuen him any hard words of late 
ophe no my good lord but as you did command 
 did repell his letters and denyde 
his accesse to me 

pol that hath made him mad 
 am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement 
 had not quoted him  feare he did but trifle 
and meant to wracke thee but beshrew my iealousie 
it seemes it is as proper to our age 
to cast beyond our selues in our opinions 
as it is common for the yonger sort 
to lacke discretion come go we to the king 
this must be knowne being kept close might moue 
more greefe to hide then hate to vtter loue

but better lookd into he truly found 
it was against your highnesse whereat greeued 
that so his sicknesse age and impotence 
was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests 
on fortinbras which he in breefe obeyes 
receiues rebuke from norwey and in fine 
makes vow before his vnkle neuer more 
to giue th assay of armes against your maiestie 
whereon old norwey ouercome with ioy

and pittie it is true  foolish figure 
but farewell it for  will vse no art

that we finde out the cause of this effect 
or rather say the cause of this defect 
for this effect defectiue comes by cause

that she sends you to prison hither 
guil prison my lord

wards and dungeons denmarke being one oth 
worst 

rosin we thinke not so my lord 

ham why then tis none to you for there is nothing 
either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is 
a prison 

rosin why then your ambition makes it one tis 
too narrow for your minde 

ham  god  could be bounded in a nutshell and 
count my selfe a king of infinite space were it not that 
 haue bad dreames 

guil which dreames indeed are ambition for the 
very substance of the ambitious is meerely the shadow 
of a dreame

sent for and there is a kinde confession in your lookes 
which your modesties haue not craft enough to color 
 know the good king  queene haue sent for you 

rosin to what end my lord 
ham that you must teach me but let mee coniure 
you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of 
our youth by the obligation of our euerpreserued loue 
and by what more deare a better proposer could charge 
you withall be euen and direct with me whether you 
were sent for or no 

rosin what say you

guil my lord we were sent for 

ham  will tell you why so shall my anticipation 
preuent your discouery of your secricie to the king and 
queene moult no feather  haue of late but wherefore 
 know not lost all my mirth forgone all custome of exercise 
and indeed it goes so heauenly with my disposition 
that this goodly frame the earth seemes to me a sterrill 
promontory this most excellent canopy the ayre 
look you this braue orehanging this maiesticall roofe 
fretted with golden fire why it appeares no other thing 
to mee then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours 
what a piece of worke is a man how noble in 
reason how infinite in faculty in forme and mouing 
how expresse and admirable in action how like an angel 
in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the 
world the parragon of animals and yet to me what is 
this quintessence of dust man delights not me no 
nor woman neither though by your smiling you seeme 
to say so 

rosin my lord there was no such stuffe in my 
thoughts 

ham why did you laugh when  said man delights 
not me 
rosin to thinke my lord if you delight not in man 
what lenton entertainment the players shall receiue 
from you wee coated them on the way and hither are 
they comming to offer you seruice 

ham he that playes the king shall be welcome his 
maiesty shall haue tribute of mee the aduenturous 
knight shal vse his foyle and target the louer shall 
not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in 
peace the clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs 
are tickled ath sere and the lady shall say her minde 
freely or the blanke verse shall halt fort what players 
are they 
rosin euen those you were wont to take delight in 
the tragedians of the city 

ham how chances it they trauaile their residence 
both in reputation and profit was better both 
wayes 

rosin  thinke their inhibition comes by the meanes 
of the late innouation 
ham doe they hold the same estimation they did 
when  was in the city are they so followd 
rosin no indeed they are not 

ham how comes it doe they grow rusty 
rosin nay their indeauour keepes in the wonted 
pace but there is sir an ayrie of children little 
yases that crye out on the top of question and 
are most tyrannically clapt fort these are now the 
fashion and so beratled the common stages so they 
call them that many wearing rapiers are affraide of 
goosequils and dare scarse come thither 

ham what are they children who maintains em 
how are they escorted will they pursue the quality no 
longer then they can sing will they not say afterwards 
if they should grow themselues to common players as 
it is most like if their meanes are not better their writers 
do them wrong to make them exclaim against their 
owne succession 

rosin faith there has bene much to do on both sides 
and the nation holds it no sinne to tarre them to controuersie 
there was for a while no mony bid for argument 
vnlesse the poet and the player went to cuffes in 
the question 

ham ist possible

braines

ham  heard thee speak me a speech once but it was 
neuer acted or if it was not aboue once for the play  
remember pleasd not the million twas cauiarie to the 
generall but it was as  receiud it and others whose 
iudgement in such matters cried in the top of mine an 
excellent play well digested in the scoenes set downe 
with as much modestie as cunning  remember one said 
there was no sallets in the lines to make the matter sauory 
nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the 
author of affectation but cald it an honest method one 
cheefe speech in it  cheefely loud twas aeneas tale 
to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks 
of priams slaughter if it liue in your memory begin at 
this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like 
thhyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus 
the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable armes 
blacke as his purpose did the night resemble 
when he lay couched in the ominous horse 
hath now this dread and blacke complexion smeard 
with heraldry more dismall head to foote 
now is he to take geulles horridly trickd 
with blood of fathers mothers daughters sonnes 
bakd and impasted with the parching streets 
that lend a tyrannous and damned light 
to their vilde murthers roasted in wrath and fire 
and thus oresized with coagulate gore 
with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus 
olde grandsire priam seekes 

pol fore god my lord well spoken with good accent 
and good discretion 

 anon he findes him 
striking too short at greekes his anticke sword 
rebellious to his arme lyes where it falles 
repugnant to command vnequall match 
pyrrhus at priam driues in rage strikes wide 
but with the whiffe and winde of his fell sword 
th vnnerued father fals then senselesse illium 
seeming to feele his blow with flaming top 
stoopes to his bace and with a hideous crash 
takes prisoner pyrrhus eare for loe his sword 
which was declining on the milkie head 
of reuerend priam seemd ith ayre to sticke 
so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood 
and like a newtrall to his will and matter did nothing 
but as we often see against some storme 
 silence in the heauens the racke stand still 
the bold windes speechlesse and the orbe below 
as hush as death anon the dreadfull thunder 
doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause 
 rowsed vengeance sets him new aworke 
and neuer did the cyclops hammers fall 
on mars his armours forgd for proofe eterne 
with lesse remorse then pyrrhus bleeding sword 
now falles on priam 
out out thou strumpetfortune all you gods 
in generall synod take away her power 
breake all the spokes and fallies from her wheele 
and boule the round naue downe the hill of heauen 
as low as to the fiends

about her lanke and all oreteamed loines 
 blanket in th alarum of feare caught vp 
who this had seene with tongue in venome steepd 
gainst fortunes state would treason haue pronouncd 
but if the gods themselues did see her then 
when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport 
in mincing with his sword her husbands limbes 
the instant burst of clamour that she made 
vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all 
would haue made milche the burning eyes of heauen

get from him why he puts on this confusion 
grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet 
with turbulent and dangerous lunacy 

rosin he does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted 
but from what cause he will by no meanes speake 

guil nor do we finde him forward to be sounded 
but with a crafty madnesse keepes aloofe 
when we would bring him on to some confession 
of his true state 

qu did he receiue you well 
rosin most like a gentleman 

guild but with much forcing of his disposition 

rosin niggard of question but of our demands 
most free in his reply 

qu did you assay him to any pastime 
rosin madam it so fell out that certaine players 
we orewrought on the way of these we told him 
and there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy 
to heare of it they are about the court 
and as  thinke they haue already order 
this night to play before him 

pol tis most true 
and he beseechd me to intreate your maiesties 
to heare and see the matter 

king with all my heart and it doth much content me 
to heare him so inclind good gentlemen 
giue him a further edge and driue his purpose on 
to these delights 

rosin we shall my lord

whether tis nobler in the minde to suffer 
the slings and arrowes of outragious fortune

the heartake and the thousand naturall shockes 
that flesh is heyre too tis a consummation 
deuoutly to be wishd to dye to sleepe 
to sleepe perchance to dreame  theres the rub 
for in that sleepe of death what dreames may come

that makes calamity of so long life

the insolence of office and the spurnes 
that patient merit of the vnworthy takes

enter prologue 

for vs and for our tragedie 
heere stooping to your clemencie 
we begge your hearing patientlie 

ham is this a prologue or the poesie of a ring 
ophe tis briefe my lord 

ham as womans loue 
enter king and his queene 

king full thirtie times hath phoebus cart gon round 
neptunes salt wash and tellus orbed ground 
and thirtie dozen moones with borrowed sheene 
about the world haue times twelue thirties beene 
since loue our hearts and hymen did our hands 
vnite comutuall in most sacred bands 

bap so many iournies may the sunne and moone 
make vs againe count ore ere loue be done 
but woe is me you are so sicke of late 
so farre from cheere and from your former state 
that  distrust you yet though  distrust 
discomfort you my lord it nothing must 
for womens feare and loue holds quantitie 
in neither ought or in extremity 
now what my loue is proofe hath made you know 
and as my loue is sizd my feare is so 

king faith  must leaue thee loue and shortly too 
my operant powers my functions leaue to do 
and thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde 
honourd beloud and haply one as kinde 
for husband shalt thou 
bap oh confound the rest 
such loue must needs be treason in my brest 
in second husband let me be accurst 
none wed the second but who killd the first 

ham wormwood wormwood 

bapt the instances that second marriage moue 
are base respects of thrift but none of loue 
 second time  kill my husband dead 
when second husband kisses me in bed 

king  do beleeue you think what now you speak 
but what we do determine oft we breake 
purpose is but the slaue to memorie 
of violent birth but poore validitie 
which now like fruite vnripe stickes on the tree 
but fall vnshaken when they mellow bee 
most necessary tis that we forget 
to pay our selues what to our selues is debt 
what to our selues in passion we propose 
the passion ending doth the purpose lose 
the violence of other greefe or ioy 
their owne ennactors with themselues destroy 
where ioy most reuels greefe doth most lament 
greefe ioyes ioy greeues on slender accident 
this world is not for aye nor tis not strange 
that euen our loues should with our fortunes change 
for tis a question left vs yet to proue 
whether loue lead fortune or else fortune loue 
the great man downe you marke his fauourites flies 
the poore aduancd makes friends of enemies 
and hitherto doth loue on fortune tend 
for who not needs shall neuer lacke a frend 
and who in want a hollow friend doth try 
directly seasons him his enemie 
but orderly to end where  begun 
our willes and fates do so contrary run 
that our deuices still are ouerthrowne 
our thoughts are ours their ends none of our owne 
so thinke thou wilt no second husband wed 
but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead 

bap nor earth to giue me food nor heauen light 
sport and repose locke from me day and night 
each opposite that blankes the face of ioy 
meet what  would haue well and it destroy 
both heere and hence pursue me lasting strife 
if once a widdow euer  be wife 

ham if she should breake it now

 shame where is thy blush rebellious hell 
if thou canst mutine in a matrons bones

when the compulsiue ardure giues the charge 
since frost it selfe as actiuely doth burne

my vertue or my plague be it either which 
shes so coniunctiue to my life and soule 
that as the starre moues not but in his sphere 
 could not but by her the other motiue 
why to a publike count  might not go 
is the great loue the generall gender beare him 
who dipping all his faults in their affection 
would like the spring that turneth wood to stone 
conuert his gyues to graces so that my arrowes 
too slightly timbred for so loud a winde 
would haue reuerted to my bow againe

no more to vndertake it  will worke him 
to an exployt now ripe in my deuice 
vnder the which he shall not choose but fall 
and for his death no winde of blame shall breath 
but euen his mother shall vncharge the practice 
and call it accident some two monthes hence 
here was a gentleman of normandy 
iue seene my selfe and serud against the french 
and they ran well on horsebacke but this gallant 
had witchcraft int he grew into his seat 
and to such wondrous doing brought his horse 
as had he beene encorpst and demynaturd 
with the braue beast so farre he past my thought 
that  in forgery of shapes and trickes 
come short of what he did 

laer  norman wast 
kin  norman 

laer vpon my life lamound 

kin the very same 

laer  know him well he is the brooch indeed 
and iemme of all our nation 

kin hee mad confession of you 
and gaue you such a masterly report 
for art and exercise in your defence 
and for your rapier most especiall 
that he cryed out twould be a sight indeed 
if one could match you sir this report of his 
did hamlet so envenom with his enuy 
that he could nothing doe but wish and begge 
your sodaine comming ore to play with him 
now out of this 

laer why out of this my lord 
kin laertes was your father deare to you 
or are you like the painting of a sorrow 
 face without a heart 
laer why aske you this 
kin not that  thinke you did not loue your father 
but that  know loue is begun by time 
and that  see in passages of proofe 
time qualifies the sparke and fire of it 
hamlet comes backe what would you vndertake 
to show your selfe your fathers sonne indeed 
more then in words 
laer to cut his throat ith church 

kin no place indeed should murder sancturize 
reuenge should haue no bounds but good laertes 
will you doe this keepe close within your chamber 
hamlet returnd shall know you are come home 
weel put on those shall praise your excellence 
and set a double varnish on the fame 
the frenchman gaue you bring you in fine together 
and wager on your heads he being remisse 
most generous and free from all contriuing 
will not peruse the foiles so that with ease 
or with a little shuffling you may choose 
 sword vnbaited and in a passe of practice 
requit him for your father 

laer  will doot 
and for that purpose ile annoint my sword 
 bought an vnction of a mountebanke 
so mortall  but dipt a knife in it 
where it drawes blood no cataplasme so rare 
collected from all simples that haue vertue 
vnder the moone can saue the thing from death 
that is but scratcht withall ile touch my point 
with this contagion that if  gall him slightly 
it may be death 

kin lets further thinke of this 
weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes 
may fit vs to our shape if this should faile 
and that our drift looke through our bad performance 
twere better not assaid therefore this proiect 
should haue a backe or second that might hold 
if this should blast in proofe soft let me see 
weel make a solemne wager on your commings 
 hat when in your motion you are hot and dry 
as make your bowts more violent to the end 
and that he cals for drinke ile haue prepard him 
 challice for the nonce whereon but sipping 
if he by chance escape your venomd stuck 
our purpose may hold there how sweet queene 
enter queene 

queen one woe doth tread vpon anothers heele 
so fast theyl follow your sisters drownd laertes 

laer drownd  where 
queen there is a willow growes aslant a brooke 
that shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame 
there with fantasticke garlands did she come 
of crowflowers nettles daysies and long purples 
that liberall shepheards giue a grosser name 
but our cold maids doe dead mens fingers call them 
there on the pendant boughes her coronet weeds 
clambring to hang an enuious sliuer broke 
when downe the weedy trophies and her selfe 
fell in the weeping brooke her cloathes spred wide 
and mermaidlike a while they bore her vp 
which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes 
as one incapable of her owne distresse 
or like a creature natiue and indued 
vnto that element but long it could not be 
till that her garments heauy with her drinke 
puld the poore wretch from her melodious buy 
to muddy death 

laer alas then is she drownd 
queen drownd drownd 

laer too much of water hast thou poore ophelia 
and therefore  forbid my teares but yet 
it is our tricke nature her custome holds 
let shame say what it will when these are gone

enter hamlet and horatio 

ham so much for this sir now let me see the other 
you doe remember all the circumstance 

hor remember it my lord 
ham sir in my heart there was a kinde of fighting 
that would not let me sleepe me thought  lay 
worse then the mutines in the bilboes rashly 
and praise be rashnesse for it let vs know 
our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well 
when our deare plots do paule and that should teach vs 
theres a diuinity that shapes our ends 
roughhew them how we will 

hor that is most certaine 

ham vp from my cabin 
my seagowne scarft about me in the darke 
gropd  to finde out them had my desire 
fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew 
to mine owne roome againe making so bold 
my feares forgetting manners to vnseale 
their grand commission where  found horatio 
oh royall knauery an exact command 
larded with many seuerall sorts of reason 
importing denmarks health and englands too 
with hoo such bugges and goblins in my life 
that on the superuize no leasure bated 
no not to stay the grinding of the axe 
my head should be struck off 

hor ist possible 
ham heres the commission read it at more leysure 
but wilt thou heare me how  did proceed 
hor  beseech you 

ham being thus benetted round with villaines 
ere  could make a prologue to my braines 
they had begun the play  sate me downe 
deuisd a new commission wrote it faire 
 once did hold it as our statists doe 
 basenesse to write faire and laboured much 
how to forget that learning but sir now 
it did me yeomans seriuce wilt thou know 
the effects of what  wrote 
hor  good my lord 

ham an earnest coniuration from the king 
as england was his faithfull tributary 
as loue betweene them as the palme should flourish 
as peace should still her wheaten garland weare 
and stand a comma tweene their amities 
and many such like assis of great charge 
that on the view and know of these contents 
without debatement further more or lesse 
he should the bearers put to sodaine death 
not shriuing time allowed 

hor how was this seald 
ham why euen in that was heauen ordinate 
 had my fathers signet in my purse 
which was the modell of that danish seale 
folded the writ vp in forme of the other 
subscribd it gaut th impression plact it safely 
the changeling neuer knowne now the next day 
was our sea fight and what to this was sement 
thou knowst already 

hor so guildensterne and rosincrance go toot 

ham why man they did make loue to this imployment 
they are not neere my conscience their debate 
doth by their owne insinuation grow 
tis dangerous when the baser nature comes 
betweene the passe and fell incensed points 
of mighty opposites 

hor why what a king is this 
ham does it not thinkst thee stand me now vpon 
he that hath kild my king and whord my mother 
popt in betweene th election and my hopes 
throwne out his angle for my proper life 
and with such coozenage ist not perfect conscience 
to quit him with this arme and ist not to be damnd 
to let this canker of our nature come 
in further euill 

hor it must be shortly knowne to him from england 
what is the issue of the businesse there 

ham it will be short 
the interims mine and a mans lifes no more 
then to say one but  am very sorry good horatio 
that to laertes  forgot my selfe 
for by the image of my cause  see 
the portraiture of his ile count his fauours 
but sure the brauery of his griefe did put me 
into a towring passion

osr the sir king has wagd with him six barbary horses 
against the which he impond as  take it sixe french 
rapiers and poniards with their assignes as girdle 
hangers or so three of the carriages infaith are very 
deare to fancy very responsiue to the hilts most delicate 
carriages and of very liberall conceit 

ham what call you the carriages 
osr the carriages sir are the hangers 

ham the phrase would bee more germaine to the 
matter if we could carry cannon by our sides  would 
it might be hangers till then but on sixe barbary horses 
against sixe french swords their assignes and three 
liberall conceited carriages thats the french but against 
the danish why is this impond as you call it 
osr the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene 
you and him hee shall not exceed you three hits 
he hath one twelue for mine and that would come to 
imediate tryall if your lordship would vouchsafe the 
answere

that  know the drossie age dotes on only got the tune of 
the time and outward habite of encounter a kinde of 
yesty collection which carries them through  through 
the most fond and winnowed opinions and doe but blow 
them to their tryalls the bubbles are out 

hor you will lose this wager my lord 

ham  doe not thinke so since he went into france 
 haue beene in continuall practice  shall winne at the 
oddes but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about 
my heart but it is no matter

what feast is toward in thine eternall cell 
that thou so many princes at a shoote 
so bloodily hast strooke 

amb the sight is dismall 
and our affaires from england come too late 
the eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing 
to tell him his commandment is fulfilld 
that rosincrance and guildensterne are dead 
where should we haue our thankes 
hor not from his mouth 
had it th abilitie of life to thanke you 
he neuer gaue commandment for their death 
but since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question 
you from the polake warres and you from england 
are heere arriued giue order that these bodies 
high on a stage be placed to the view 
and let me speake to th yet vnknowing world 
how these things came about so shall you heare 
of carnall bloudie and vnnaturall acts 
of accidentall iudgements casuall slaughters 
of deaths put on by cunning and forcd cause 
and in this vpshot purposes mistooke 
falne on the inuentors head all this can  
truly deliuer 

for let vs hast to heare it 
and call the noblest to the audience 
for me with sorrow  embrace my fortune 
 haue some rites of memory in this kingdome 
which are to claime my vantage doth 
inuite me 
hor of that  shall haue alwayes cause to speake 
and from his mouth 
whose voyce will draw on more 
but let this same be presently performd 
euen whiles mens mindes are wilde 
lest more mischance 
on plots and errors happen 

for let foure captaines 
beare hamlet like a soldier to the stage 
for he was likely had he beene put on 
to haue proud most royally 
and for his passage 
the souldiours musicke and the rites of warre 
speake lowdly for him 
take vp the body such a sight as this 
becomes the field but heere shewes much amis 
go bid the souldiers shoote 

exeunt marching after the which a peale of ordenance are shot 
off
